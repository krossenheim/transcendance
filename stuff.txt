Mandatory part
Multi-service app with containerized deployment

Evidence: Dockerized microservices (auth, users, chat, pong, hub, db, nginx) and compose.yml.
Status: PASS
Files: compose.yml, service folders under srcs/*/Dockerfile, srcs/nginx/*
Web frontend for the application

Evidence: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind served by Nginx.
Status: PASS
Files: react_source, Dockerfile, nginx.conf.to_expand
Real-time capabilities

Evidence: Central hub + services communicate via WebSocket; chat and pong use live updates.
Status: PASS
Files: src_ts, src_ts, src_ts, socketComponent.tsx
Game (Pong) implemented

Evidence: Dedicated pong service with server-side game state and a React canvas UI.
Status: PASS
Files: src_ts (game logic classes), pongComponent.tsx
Persistence

Evidence: DB container with schema; chat rooms and messages backed by DB; users and tokens persisted.
Status: PASS
Files: structure.sql, src_ts
Security concerns (baseline)

JWT-based auth present (refresh tokens stored server-side; JWT signed in auth service).
Logout invalidates refresh token via DB.
Gaps to consider (see below).
Status: PARTIAL



Likely security gaps (actionable)
Password hashing: I couldn’t find hashing (bcrypt/argon/pbkdf2) in auth/db. If passwords are stored/compared in plaintext, that’s a blocker.
Look for hashing in src_ts or src_ts—none found.
Suggest: hash on creation; verify on login (bcrypt/argon2).
Token handling: JWT stored in localStorage on frontend; consider httpOnly secure cookies to mitigate XSS token theft. Also add a short JWT TTL (you already use 15 minutes) and a robust refresh flow (present).
Input validation and sanitization: You use Zod server-side—good. For chat messages, sanitize/encode before rendering to prevent XSS.
CORS/CSRF: WebSockets limit CSRF exposure, but if you keep any stateful HTTP endpoints, ensure CSRF mitigation (token/double-submit) or keep them strictly stateless with proper CORS.
Rate limiting/brute force: Consider rate-limit login and mutation endpoints.
Secrets: JWT secret is hardcoded in main.ts (secretKey). Move to env.
Common module areas and your coverage
Web

SPA frontend, routing (simple chat/pong tabs), live updates, modals, profile UI.
Status: PASS
User Management

Accounts: user create, guest create, login/refresh/logout.
Friends/Requests/Blocked: Implemented with Friends Manager modal and backend handlers.
Profiles: Lookup via WebSocket; profile modal; DM from profile.
2FA/OAuth: Not present (see “Gaps that are usually required”).
Status: PARTIAL (core user flows present; advanced auth missing)
Gameplay and user experience

Server-driven game state, live updates; debug controls; canvas rendering.
Status: PASS (baseline gameplay UX is there)
Chat

Public rooms + DMs, invites blocked for DM rooms (privacy), friendly DM names, listRooms updates, getRoomData loading.
Status: PASS
Cybersecurity

See “Likely security gaps.” You have a decent baseline; the subject’s “Security concerns” usually expects specific, demonstrable measures.
Status: PARTIAL
DevOps

Multi-service Dockerized stack with Nginx reverse proxy.
If CI/CD or monitoring/logging is required, I don’t see it.
Status: PARTIAL
Accessibility/Graphics

Not explicitly implemented; the UI uses Tailwind with dark mode and keyboard inputs—accessibility specifics are not evident.
Status: UNKNOWN/PARTIAL
Server-Side Pong (module)

Clear server-side model and WebSocket routes; client canvas draws from server state; inputs routed back to server.
Status: PASS
Gaps that are usually required in ft_transcendence
Caveat: Since the PDF didn’t extract cleanly, I’m listing the typical expectations that often appear in this project. If your subject version differs, let me know or share the exact section text and I’ll align precisely.

OAuth 42 (or third-party OAuth) login
Not present. Your auth supports local register/guest/refresh/logout but not 42 OAuth.
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
Not present (TOTP/email-based 2FA).
Password hashing and secure password storage
Couldn’t find bcrypt/argon or equivalent.
Avatar upload/profile customization and status presence
You have profile lookup; I didn’t see avatar upload; presence events partially (user_connected/disconnected).
Admin/moderation features or channel roles (in some variants)
Not evident.
Anti-cheat/validation for game inputs (depends on module set)
Your pong seems server-authoritative for the core state—that’s good.
Where you clearly meet/exceed
DMs work end-to-end with auto-select and friendly naming.
Friends manager (requests, accept/deny, block/unblock).
Chat rooms with invites and room data fetch; proper DM privacy invariant.
Robust room event handling and per-room message buffering in the UI.
Server-side Pong with real-time UI.
Multi-container architecture and reverse proxy setup.
Recommendations to reach spec-compliance
Pick what applies based on your chosen modules. If you target the common baseline:

Authentication hardening
Add password hashing (bcrypt/argon2).
Move JWT to httpOnly secure cookies; keep refresh tokens strictly server-side; rotate refresh tokens.
Add login rate limiting.
OAuth 42
Implement OAuth login via intra 42 endpoints (client_id/secret/redirect_uri), add a callback endpoint, bind/merge accounts.
2FA (TOTP)
Allow enabling TOTP (QR code provisioning), store secret hashed/encrypted, require 2FA on login or sensitive actions.
Security and input handling
Sanitize chat message rendering to prevent XSS (dangerous HTML).
Add CSP headers in Nginx (script-src, object-src, base-uri, etc.).
Centralize validation with Zod (already good) and ensure all WS payloads go through it.
DevOps polish
Add a basic CI (lint/build/test), maybe docker build checks.
Add a health endpoint for each service and surface in Nginx.
Optional: metrics/log aggregation (e.g., structured logs, basic dashboard).
Accessibility
Keyboard navigation, focus states, ARIA labels for modals/tabs, color contrast checks.
If you tell me which module set you’re aiming for, I’ll produce a laser-focused compliance matrix and an implementation plan (file-by-file) to close the gaps.

 but the endpoint to request user profile data works with username now
2:50
So u can actually properly make the commands like /invite now
